    <ol>
    <!--1--><li>Grind beans.</li>
    <!--2--><li>Wet the coffee filter and empty out the water.</li>
    <!--3--><li>Zero out the scale. Put grinded beans into the wet filter. Note the weight.</li>
    <!--4--><li>Double the noted weight on the scale. This is the amount of water you'll want to pour in the next step. Zero out the scale to make it easier.</li>
    <!--5--><li>Pour water in a circular motion, trying to cover as many beans as you can. When pouring, pour clockwise and outside in.</li>
    <li>Once done pouring, you'll want to let it bloom for 30 seconds. Grab a chopstick and mix up the grinded beans.</li>
    <li>After 30 seconds (and when the water is dripped through), take note of the weight on the scale.</li>
    <li>Double the weight and this is the amount of water you'll want to pour. You can zero out the scale again to make it easier. Pour clockwise from
    outside to in.</li>
    <li>Once the water is dripped through, pour water again in the amount noted before (two times).</li>
